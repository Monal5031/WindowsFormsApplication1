The test case data genarator.

Created on Visual studio 2015 update 3.

c#

.NET Framework 4.5.2

Can generate test data in a range.(even/odd) 
For n < 10000 directly copies the output to clipboard. For n>10000 creates a text file in D:/


issues:-

1.  For output less than 10000 it takes less than 1 sec to copy into the clipboard. For greater than 10000, it's just not doing         anything.(Stucking somewhere at 10%)

2. Taking too much time to create txt files.


Things to be added:-

1. String return type
2. Time improvements
